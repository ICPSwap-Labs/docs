# Adding Liquidity

## Introduction

This guide will cover how to modify a liquidity position by adding liquidity in ICPSwap. Before starting, try to get the id of ICP - ckBTC SwapPool canister by [Searching a Pool](../../01.SwapFactory/01.Searching_a_Pool.md). In the returned data, it can be determined what tokens token0 and token1 are in the current SwapPool.

For this guide, the following canister ids are used:
|Name|Principal|
|:-|:-:|
|SwapPool of ICP - ckBTC|xmiu5-jqaaa-aaaag-qbz7q-cai|
|ICP|ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai|
|ckBTC|mxzaz-hqaaa-aaaar-qaada-cai|

## Detail

SwapPool Candid

```
type DepositArgs = record { fee : nat; token : text; amount :nat };

type Error = variant {
    CommonError;
    InternalError : text;
    UnsupportedToken : text;
    InsufficientFunds;
};   

type IncreaseLiquidityArgs = record {
  positionId : nat;
  amount0Desired : text;
  amount1Desired : text;
};

type WithdrawArgs = record { fee : nat; token : text; amount : nat };

type Result = variant { ok : nat; err : Error };

type Result_7 = variant {
  ok : record { balance0 : nat; balance1 : nat };
  err : Error;
};

type Result_11 = variant { ok : vec nat; err : Error };

type SwapPool = service {
    deposit : (DepositArgs) -> (Result);
    depositFrom : (DepositArgs) -> (Result);
    getUserPositionIdsByPrincipal : (principal) -> (Result_11) query;
    getUserUnusedBalance : (principal) -> (Result_7) query;
    increaseLiquidity : (IncreaseLiquidityArgs) -> (Result);
    withdraw : (WithdrawArgs) -> (Result);
}
service : SwapPool
```

## Workflow

![Increase Liquidity](../../_img/increase_liquidity.png)

### Step 1

Use the **getUserPositionIdsByPrincipal** method to get the position ids held by the user based on the user principal, and pick one of the ids for the liquidity increasing operation.

### Step 2 & Step 3

If the standard of input token is DIP20, EXT, ICP or ICRC2, follow these 2 steps to deposit.

Refer to the interfaces of the token itself, giving approval for particular SwapPool to transfer your tokens.

Then use **depositFrom** to transfer tokens from the caller to the SwapPool, and record the amount of token to the caller's account in current SwapPool.

In the input parameters:
+ *token* is the principal of token which will be deposited.
+ *amount* is the amount of deposited token multiplied by 10**decimals. For example, the decimals of ckBTC is 8, so input 11115 here means 0.00011115 ckBTC.
+ *fee* is the fee of deposited token. For example, the fee of ckBTC is 10.

In the output parameter, the result is the amount of deposited token multiplied by 10**decimals.

### Step 4 & Step 5

If the standard of input token is ICRC1, follow these 2 steps to deposit.

Refer to the interfaces of the token itself, transfer token to the subaccount of the operator's principal under the SwapPool.

For example, transfer 1 ICP to the subaccount under the SwapPool of ICP - ckBTC. The '$subaccount' in this command is the subaccount of the operator's principal.

```
dfx canister --network=ic call ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai icrc1_transfer '(record {from_subaccount = null; to = record {owner = principal "xmiu5-jqaaa-aaaag-qbz7q-cai"; subaccount = opt blob "$subaccount";}; amount = 100000000:nat; fee = opt 10000:nat; memo = null; created_at_time = null;})'
```

```
public func principalToBlob(p: Principal): Blob {
    var arr: [Nat8] = Blob.toArray(Principal.toBlob(p));
    var defaultArr: [var Nat8] = Array.init<Nat8>(32, 0);
    defaultArr[0] := Nat8.fromNat(arr.size());
    var ind: Nat = 0;
    while (ind < arr.size() and ind < 32) {
        defaultArr[ind + 1] := arr[ind];
        ind := ind + 1;
    };
    return Blob.fromArray(Array.freeze(defaultArr));
};
```

Use **deposit** to transfer token from the subaccount under the SwapPool to the SwapPool itself, and record the amount of token to the caller's account in current SwapPool.

In the input parameters:
+ *token* is the principal of token which will be deposited.
+ *amount* is the amount of deposited token multiplied by 10**decimals. For example, the decimals of ICP is 8, so input 100000000 here means 1 ICP.
+ *fee* is the fee of deposited token. For example, the fee of ICP is 10000.

In the output parameter, the result is the amount of deposited token multiplied by 10**decimals.

### Step 6

Based on the previously queried position id and the amounts of tokens deposited into the SwapPool, use **increaseLiquidity** to perform an increase liquidity operation on the position.

In the input parameters:
+ *positionId* is the position id to be increased liquidity.
+ *amount0Desired* is the amount of deposited token0 multiplied by 10**decimals. For example, token0 in this SwapPool is ckBTC, and the decimals of ckBTC is 8, so input 11115 here means 0.00011115 ckBTC.
+ *amount1Desired* is the amount of deposited token1 multiplied by 10**decimals. For example, token1 in this SwapPool is ICP, and the decimals of ICP is 8, so input 100000000 here means 1 ICP.

In the output parameter, the result is the id of the position.

## Exception Handling

### deposit failed

Before the **deposit** method is called, the user's token is transferred under their sub-account in the SwapPool. If the **deposit** method call fails, you can try to re-call **deposit**. Then proceed to the next step in the trading, or you can also use the **withdraw** method to extract the tokens that were deposited in.

### increaseLiquidity failed

If the increaseLiquidity method call fails, the deposited token balance will still be recorded in that user's account in SwapPool, which can be queried through the **getUserUnusedBalance** method by user's principal. In this case, the user can use the **withdraw** method to extract the tokens, or recall the **increaseLiquidity** method again based on the result of **getUserUnusedBalance**.
