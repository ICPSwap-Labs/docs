# Getting a Quote

## Introduction

This guide will cover how to get the current quotes for any token pair in ICPSwap. 
Before starting, try to get the id of ICP - ckBTC SwapPool canister by [Searching_a_Pool](../../SwapFactory/01.Searching_a_Pool.md). In the returned data, it can be determined what tokens token0 and token1 are in the current SwapPool.

In this example we will use **quote** to get a quote for the pair ICP - ckBTC. The inputs are the *zeroForOne* symbol, the *amountIn* and the *amountOutMinimum*.

For this guide, the following canister ids are used:
|Name|Principal|
|:-|:-:|
|SwapPool of ICP - ckBTC|xmiu5-jqaaa-aaaag-qbz7q-cai|

## Command

By the output data of [Searching a Pool](../Factory/Searching%20a%20Pool.md), we can see that in the SwapPool of pair ICP - ckBTC, the token0 is ckBTC, and the token1 is ICP.

```
dfx canister --network=ic call xmiu5-jqaaa-aaaag-qbz7q-cai quote '(record { zeroForOne = false; amountIn = "100000000"; amountOutMinimum = "0"; })'
```

## Detail

SwapPool Candid

```
type Error = variant {
   CommonError;
   InsufficientFunds;
   InternalError: text;
   UnsupportedToken: text;
 };

type Result = variant { ok : nat; err : Error };

type SwapArgs = record {
  amountIn : text;
  zeroForOne : bool;
  amountOutMinimum : text;
};

type SwapPool = service {
    quote : (SwapArgs) -> (Result) query;
}

service : SwapPool
```

In the input parameters:
+ *zeroForOne* is the symbol for trading direction. If token0 swaps token1, then *true*, otherwise *false*.
+ *amountIn* is the amount of input token multiplied by 10**decimals. For example, the decimals of ICP is 8, so input 100000000 here means 1 ICP.
+ *amountOutMinimum* is the expected minimum amount of output token. Used as a sliding point restriction in **swap** function, but 0 is ok here.

In the output parameter, the result is the quote amount of output token multiplied by 10**decimals.
